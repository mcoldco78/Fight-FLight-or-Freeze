<h1> Project Road Map </h1>

1.  DONE - JH -  Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Brainstorm the layout of my story on paper. Put story development into distnict sections.**
1.  DONE - JH -  Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Copy over the titles of the sections into code. Lable each one with a #, as this will act as the skeleton of the story.**
1.  DONE - JH -  Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Watch videos on python story-based games and example codebases, during which, make note of code and other info that would be incorporated into my code. Keep track of this on a notepad document.**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Incorporate the notes taken into the respective code/section of the story created in step two.**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code 1/3rd of the sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results.**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code 2/3rd of the sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code last third of the sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Run through all of the code in one sitting for bugs. Make note of any bugs (if there are any) in a notepad document. Go into code and itemize and fix bugs. Run through until it's perfect, screenshot of clear code results**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Run through story and make notes that it makes sense and there are no plot holes.Document discreptincies in notepad,turn back into code and fix story.**
1.  DONE - JH - Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Upload to github and test to make sure it works and is downloadable, screenshot running code on website as well as downlaoded code from github.**
