1. [x] DONE - JH -  Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Watch videos on python story-based games and example codebases, during which, make note of code and other info that would be incorporated into code. Keep track of this on a notepad document.**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Incorporate the notes take into the respective code/section of the story.**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code 1/3rd of the segemented sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results.**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code 2/3rd of the segemented sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Code last third of the segemented sections and run it for clarity, screenshot clear code results**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Run through all of the code in one sitting for bugs. Make note of any bugs (if there are any) in a notepad document. Go into code and itemize and fix bugs. Run through until it's perfect, screenshot of clear code results**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Run through story and make notes that it makes sense and there are no plot holes.Document discreptincies in notepad,turn back into code and fix story.**
1. [ ] Responsibility: Justin Hawkins  - **Upload to github and test to make sure it works and is downloadable, screenshot running code on website as well as downlaoded code from github.**
